            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>It was named Jordan after the Jordan River. The word Jordan consists of "Jor" and "Dan", as it is a plural of the name of the tributary of the sacred river passing through Jordan, Jur (Baniyas) and its tributary Dan (Al-Ladan), so the name becomes Jordan and Jordan in some languages. With time, it became Jordan and Jordan, and the Arabs called it Jordan. The area adjacent to the Jordan River, from its source to its mouth on both sides, was known both as “Jordan” and as “Palestine.” The word "Jordan" means strength and victory, and it was said that Jordan is one of Noah's descendants. The Bible Dictionary states that Jordan is a Hebrew name that means slope, and it is the most important river in Palestine. The Greek name for Jordan is jordanem and Jordan, which means steep or deep slope. The Greeks and Romans called the country of Jordan the word "Jordanian theme", which is a military name, as Jordan was the headquarters of a military province. The Arab conquerors also called the regions of the Levant the "Junds", and among them was the "Jund Al-Jordan", which included part of southern Lebanon and northern Palestine, as well as parts of Syria. As for the name of East Jordan; It was known for the first time in the Crusader era, and the first name with this meaning was transmitted by William of Tyre, the historian of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. He called it ultra jordanem and stated that it included countries; Gilead, Ammon, and Moab, and it is sometimes called Trans Jordan, which means the country beyond the river, across the Jordan, or also east of the Jordan. When King Abdullah bin Al-Hussein founded the Jordanian Emirate, he called the country the Emirate of the Arab East, and then the Emirate became independent under the name Emirate of Transjordan. After that, it became known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and the Kingdom because its system of government is a monarchy, and the Hashemites are in reference to Bani Hashem because the kings of Jordan have their origins from Hashem, the great-grandfather of the Prophet Muhammad.</p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Man lived on the land of Jordan in several periods, starting from the Paleolithic Age (500,000-14,000) BC and the Middle Stone Age (14,000-8000) BC, where two-sided hand axes were found made of flint and basalt. The weather in Jordan was always rainy, and man lived on Hunting wild animals and collecting wild plants.<br>
                In 2018, researchers announced the discovery of charred remains of bread prepared 14,500 years ago at a site in northeastern Jordan, which was later found to be the oldest in the world, more than four thousand years before the discovery of agriculture. This “exceptional event” motivates scientists to search for a link between bread production and the origins of agriculture.<br>
                Human activity and living on the land of Jordan continued until the Early Neolithic Age (8000-6000) BC and the later Neolithic Age (6000-4500) BC, when the country witnessed some developments in multiple aspects of life. Great kingdoms lived on this part of the land, such as the Nabatean Kingdom, whose capital was Petra, the Moabites, the Edomites, the Byzantines, and the Romans. Traces of the Islamic Empire are still visible, as are traces of the Ottoman Empire. On May 25, 1946, after the end of the British Mandate, the United Nations agreed to recognize Jordan as an independent, sovereign kingdom.
